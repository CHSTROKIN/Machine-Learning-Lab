# linear-regression
This is the the model of linear regression.
I created this program couple days ago. I am too boring, and I don't know what to use with this program. Therefore, I decide to used it to calcuate odd numbers, sound silly right?
You can use it( who will? ) what ever you want. 

本人菜鸡，第一次写线性回归，numpy写的框架，不知道干什么，就用来计算奇数，用于给社员门从数学上理解线性回归的原理
